Business Case: Jamboree Education - Linear Regression

# Jamboree Education - Linear Regression 📊

Welcome to the Jamboree Linear Regression project! 🎉 

## About Jamboree

Jamboree has helped thousands of students like you make it to top colleges abroad. Be it GMAT, GRE or SAT, their unique problem-solving methods ensure maximum scores with minimum effort.
They recently launched a feature where students/learners can come to their website and check their probability of getting into the IVY league college. This feature estimates the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective.

## Business Problem 📈
Analysis will help Jamboree in understanding what factors are important in graduate admissions and how these factors are interrelated among themselves. It will also help predict one's chances of admission given the rest of the variables.

## Dataset/ Column Profiling:📋

The dataset at the heart of this exploration. Here are some of the key features:

- **Serial No.**: Unique row ID
- **GRE Scores**: Scores out of 340
- **TOEFL Scores**: Scores out of 120
- **University Rating**: Rating out of 5
- **Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength**: Rating out of 5
- **Undergraduate GPA**: GPA out of 10
- **Research Experience**: Binary indicator (0 or 1)
- **Chance of Admit**: Probability ranging from 0 to 1

## 🚀 Mission 🚀

To get you started, here are some questions you might consider:

## Project Summary

1. **Data Import & Initial Analysis**: 
   - Load the dataset, examine its structure, and drop any unique row identifiers to avoid model bias.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
   - Use both graphical and non-graphical methods to analyze variable distributions and ensure a diverse applicant pool.

3. **Variable Relationships**: 
   - Check correlations and interactions between variables that impact graduate admissions.

4. **Linear Regression Model**: 
   - Build a model with the Statsmodels library, interpret results, and test assumptions:
     - **Multicollinearity**: Check using VIF scores.
     - **Residual Analysis**: Ensure residuals meet assumptions of zero mean, linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality.

5. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Assess model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, R², and adjusted R² scores.

6. **Insights & Recommendations**: 
   - Provide actionable insights based on the analysis and experiment with different linear regression models.
